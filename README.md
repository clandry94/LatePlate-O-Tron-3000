LatePlate-O-Tron-3000
================

Welcome to the LatePlate-O-Tron 3000. The LPoT was created by Conor Landry to solve the monotonous, daily chore of managing late plates (breakfast and dinner plates for members that aren't available to pick them up themselves) for members of the Florida Chapter of Delta Upsilon.

Planned features
-----------
Currently, the first milestone of the LPoT was released on 3/1/2016. There is still a lot to be done, and it would be hard to say that the system is ready for production use as it is still a WiP.

I plan on completing the following:
  - ~~Individual users and authentication system~~ DONE
  - ~~Removal of daily plates~~ and modification of recurring plates (removal DONE)
  - ~~Implementation of message sending to chefs (script is complete, mainly need implemented)~~ DONE
  - Dinner Manager dashboard for complete control of message sending, plates, etc.
  - And many more

Requirements
-------------

This application requires:

- Ruby 2.3.0
- Rails 4.2.3
- PostgreSQL3
